# **LocalizationComponent.jsx, Languages.jsx**

1. **useState Hook:**

    - `const [activeId, setActiveId] = useState(1);` initializes a state variable `activeId` with a default value of `1`. This state is used to track which language is currently active (selected by the user).

2. **Languages Object:**

    - `const Values = Languages.LocalizationButtons();` calls a method from the `Languages` object that returns an array of objects. Each object represents a language option with properties `id`, `text` (the name of the language as it appears on the button), and `textId` (a unique identifier for the language).

3. **LocalizationComponent:**

    - This is a functional React component that takes a single prop `handleLangChange`, which is a function intended to handle the language change logic when a user clicks a language button.
    - The component maps over the `Values` array to render a button for each language option. Each button has a `key` prop set to its `textId` for React to manage the list efficiently.
    - The `onClick` handler for each button is set to call the `handleClick` function with the button's `id` and `textId`. When clicked, `handleClick` will:
        - Call `handleLangChange(textId)` to update the application's state with the new language.
        - Call `setActiveId(id)` to update the `activeId` state, which affects the button's class for styling purposes.

4. **Button Styling:**

    - The `className` for each button is determined by comparing `activeId` to the `id` of the language option. If they match, the button is assigned the `activeLanguage` class; otherwise, it gets the `inactiveLanguage` class. This allows for visual feedback on which language is currently active.

5. **PropTypes:**

    - `LocalizationComponent.propTypes` defines the expected type for the `handleLangChange` prop, ensuring that it is always provided and that it is a function. This is important for type-checking and helps prevent bugs related to incorrect prop usage.

6. **ExampleText Method:**

    - The `Languages` object also contains an `ExampleText` method, which returns an object with localized strings for each language. This method isn't used directly in the `LocalizationComponent`, but it would be used elsewhere in the application to display the correct text based on the currently selected language.
